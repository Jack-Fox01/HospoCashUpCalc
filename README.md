The Hospitality Cash Up Calculator is a small project that I thought of a while back to help me with my current role. This was the starting stages of my first fully fledged idea. 
I thought using python would be a good choice, as at that time I was using it fairly often. 
The next stages will be taking thris project into its beta where I will be taking it into Java.
