ðŸ’· Cash Input & Removal Assistant (Python)
A simple command-line Python utility to calculate the total value of entered UK currency denominations and suggest which denominations to remove if the total exceeds Â£100.

ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Accepts mixed UK denominations (notes and coins)
- Allows fractional input for coins (e.g., 1.5 x 20p)
- Automatically calculates total cash value
- Suggests which denominations to remove if over a Â£100 threshold
- Friendly and clear CLI interaction

ðŸ§° How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter quantities of various UK denominations.
- The program calculates the total cash value.
- If the total exceeds Â£100, it suggests denominations to remove in order to bring the total back down to Â£100 or less.

ðŸ”§ Potential Improvements
- Add GUI using Tkinter or PyQt
- Support for custom threshold (not just Â£100)
- Export summary to a file (e.g., CSV or text)
- Add support for more international currencies
